# Scheduling
I am here to perform some sorceries!
Nothing crazy, I will just (try to) create some python coding to allow the creation of a schedule, it will contain some functions for the sake of fun!

## 23/01/2023
Updated the code to force the durations to be exclusively integer. At the end, the schedule will show the permutation of jobs and its makespan.
