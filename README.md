# Scheduling
I am here to perform some sorceries!
Nothing crazy, I will just (try to) create some python coding to allow the creation of a schedule, it will contain some functions for the sake of fun!

Updated the code to force the durations to be exclusively integer. At the end, the schedule will show the permutation of jobs and its makespan.

Updated the code to include information in regards to the weighted makespan of the schedule. 
This project was meant to reflect a **human environement**. In scheduling theory, the methods and art we learned was adapted for a machine based environement, as one of the basics of the theory stated that **machine can process a given job with full capacity after finishing its prior task, and that there are no ressources to be consumed.** 

The weighted makespan represents a score that a human achieves after performing all the tasks. The weight in this context represents the stamina and that defaults to 1 for all the jobs(for now); everytime a job is added, the weight of the next job will be reduced by 0,1.

What I plan to do soon is to make it so that adding a task named "Pause/pause" will restore the weight's value to 1, and add a function that allows a schedule netting the best performance.

Updated the code. Adding a job named "Pause" or "pause" will cause the weight/Stamina to revert back to 1. I have no music to share for now, how about I share a small picture that I love ?
