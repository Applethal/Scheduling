# Scheduling
I am here to perform some sorceries!
Nothing crazy, I will just (try to) create some python coding to allow the creation of a schedule, it will contain some functions for the sake of fun!

Updated the code to force the durations to be exclusively integer. At the end, the schedule will show the permutation of jobs and its makespan.

Updated the code to include information in regards to the weighted makespan of the schedule. 
This project was meant to reflect a **human environement**. In scheduling theory, the methods and art we learned was adapted for a machine based environement, as one of the basics of the theory stated that **machine can process a given job with full capacity after finishing its prior task, and that there are no ressources to be consumed.** 

The weighted makespan represents a score that a human achieves after performing all the tasks. The weight in this context represents the stamina and that defaults to 1 for all the jobs(for now); everytime a job is added, the weight of the next job will be reduced by 0,1.

What I plan to do soon is to make it so that adding a task named "Pause/pause" will restore the weight's value to 1, and add a function that allows a schedule netting the best performance.

Updated the code. Adding a job named "Pause" or "pause" will cause the weight/Stamina to revert back to 1. I have no music to share for now, consider this picture instead.

What's next ? I will create an optimization problem out of this idea.

Updated the code. A list of jobs sorted by duration in a descending manner will be printed, this will be needed much later for the optimization idea that I plan to implement, hopefully I will be able to finish it today.[On my music playlist, Jane's addiction came up while I was learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV3ozZoQ13M)

Reached my first road block. Spent 2 days looking for solutions for this matter. It appears that the problem belongs to the "Online Scheduling" Categorie, which is famous for having Np-hard problems. My problem goes as follows: subject to a due date, fill your schedule in a way that maximizes the score (score is defined by the weight times the duration). Sure, looks like a knapsack problem, well guess what: let us not forget that each time you add a task/job, the weight for the next job decreases by 0.1; Taking a pause recovers the weight of the next job to its default value. A perfect replica of what how a life form with no coffee and steroids would function.

I have tried to model this problem mathematically:

$$Max \space Z: = \sum\limits_{d \in D} d_j.w_j.X_j + d_p.w_j.X_p$$

Subject to: 

$$ X_j <= 1 (\forall j \in J) $$

$$ X_p <=1 (\forall p \in J) $$

$$ w_{j+1} = X_p + (X_{j-1} . (w_{j-1} - 0,1 )) (\forall J+1 \in J) $$  

$$ \sum\limits_{j \in J}\sum\limits_{p \in J} X_p.d_j + X_j.d_j <= D (\forall J,p \in J) $$


$$ X_p, X_j \in \{0,1\} $$

 $$ w >= 0$$


The Obj. Funtion aims to maximize the score while the constraints insure the feasibility of the operation. I have tried to implement some classic branch and cut algorithms but the complexity was so high that it motivated me to go look up for some literature with the hopes to find a computationally acceptable manner. Of course Smith's ratio rule would not help here unless we had no pauses to work with, So what I did was to update the code in a way that gives you a schedule with the maximum possible score whilst ignoring the pausing mechanism. Eternal rest from is one of my favourite songs, (give it a try while cooking but not while coding!)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekf1ttmZSao]
